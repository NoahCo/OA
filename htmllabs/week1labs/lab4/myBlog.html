            <p> Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and 
            Larry Sanger.[11] Sanger coined its name,[12][13] a portmanteau of 
            wiki[notes 4] and encyclopedia. There was only the English language
            version initially, but it quickly developed similar versions in other
            languages, which differ in content and in editing practices.

        <p>In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from
            Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia, and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy 
            approached Encyclopædia Britannica's.[17] Criticism of Wikipedia includes claims 
            that it exhibits systemic bias, presents a mixture of "truths, half truths, and 
            some falsehoods",[18] and that, in controversial topics, it is subject to 
            manipulation and spin.[19]

            Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online
            English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by
            experts and reviewed under a formal process.[11] Nupedia was founded 
            on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company.

               Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language
               edition at www.wikipedia.com,[28] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia 
               mailing list.[24] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[29] was 
               codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules
               initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[24] Originally,
               Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[30]

            Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings,
            and web search engine indexing. By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 
            8,000 articles.[31] On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 
            articles.[32] By the end of 2001, it had grown to approximately 20,000

            articles and 18 language editions. It had reached 26 language editions
            by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004.
            [33] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were 
            taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia
            .
